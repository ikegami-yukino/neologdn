## Get Started

Here's how to set up neologdn for local development.

1. Fork the neologdn repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ikegami-yukino/neologdn.git
```

3. Create a branch for local development:

```sh
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```
Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests:

python test_neologdn.py
```

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
